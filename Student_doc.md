\# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

Smart Cuisine aims to develop an application to discover new recipes and check their nutritional values in order to monitor the daily intake of macronutrients.  
This application aims to improve the quality of the food intake and to give new ideas to people who want to eat in a healthier way, without giving up on tasty meals.  
The application meets the needs of the users with dietary restrictions given by health issues, intolerances and religious or moral choices.  
To achieve the previous purposes the system allows short-term and medium-term meal planning for the following days.  
The type of users which could be interested about this application are personal trainers, people who can’t afford a dietist or prefer to plan their meals by themselves.  
Another possible user could be a person who uses the application to write down his shopping list and check the nutritional values of the items in the list.

\#\# CONTAINER\_NAME: StorageManagement

\#\#\# DESCRIPTION: 

The StorageManagement container is responsible for managing the storage of ingredients for users. It provides functionalities to add, retrieve, update, and delete ingredients in the user's storage. Users can set expiration dates, track ingredient quantities, and move ingredients from their shopping lists to their storage. This container ensures efficient inventory management for users, helping them keep track of their available ingredients.

\#\#\# USER STORIES:

8\) As a registered user, I want to add my ingredients to the storage so that I can keep track of the ingredients I have at home.   
9\) As a registered user, I want to delete an ingredient from my storage so that I can delete an ingredient I used for a recipe.   
15\) As a registered user, I want to move the ingredients from my shopping list to my ingredients storage so that I can keep track of what I bought.   
17\) As a registered user, I want to set the expiration date for the ingredients in my storage so that I can remember when they will expire.   
19\) As a registered user, I want to set the quantity for the ingredient in my storage so that I can know the quantities of each ingredient in the storage.

\#\#\# PERSISTENCE EVALUATION

The StorageManagement container requires persistent storage to manage the ingredients stored by users. It needs to store data such as the ingredient ID, username, quantity, and expiration date of each ingredient. This ensures that users can keep track of the ingredients they have at home, monitor their quantities, and be aware of when ingredients are nearing expiration. 

\#\#\# EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS  
The StorageManagement container does not connect to external services.

\- TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION:  
The microservice is developed in Java 21 and uses the Java Spring Boot framework version 3.4.1.  
Spring Boot:  
Several Spring Boot starter dependencies are included:  
\- Tomcat: The microservice uses TomcatWebServer as a web server to serve the Spring Boot application in a production environment.  
   
\- JWT (Jsonwebtoken): The microservice handles JSON Web Tokens (JWT), commonly used for secure token-based authentication.  
   
\- spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: The service interacts with a relational database using JPA (Java Persistence API).  
   
\- postgresql: Provides the PostgreSQL JDBC driver, enabling Java applications to interact with a PostgreSQL database for data storage and retrieval.  
   
\- lombok: A Java library that reduces boilerplate code by generating commonly used methods like getters, setters, toString, equals, and hashCode at compile time through annotations.  
   
\- spring-boot-starter-test: This is included for unit and integration testing purposes.  
   
\- spring-boot-starter-web: This is used for building web applications, including RESTful APIs.  
   
\- spring-boot-starter-security: Provides basic security features for Spring Boot applications, including authentication, authorization, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF).  
   
\- spring-security-test: A test dependency for Spring Security, offering utilities to test security configurations and integration scenarios in Spring Boot applications.  
   
\- jakarta.validation-api: Defines the standard API for Java Bean Validation, used to validate object properties using annotations. 

\- Maven: The build process is managed by Apache Maven, with plugins such as spring-boot-maven-plugin for packaging the application and maven-compiler-plugin for compiling the code with Java 21\.

\- SERVICE ARCHITECTURE:   
The service is realized with:  
    \- a controller to manage routes, request parameters and responses. It handles the business logic of the microservice.  
    \- a model directory for defining the entities represented in the db  
    \- a dto directory with all the classes related to requests bodies and responses.  
    \- repositories to interact with the database and make queries.  
    \- a service directory for defining the util functions for the controller  
    \- an utility directory for managing the JWT context  
    \- a security directory for managing the request filters and all the security stuffs
